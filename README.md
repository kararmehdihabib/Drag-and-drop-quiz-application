# Task

## 1. Setup
```bash
npm install
```
- install all npm and bower dependencies

**Note:** If `npm install` fails during dependency installation it will be likely caused by `gulp-imagemin`. In that case remove `gulp-imagemin` dependency from `package.json`, run `npm install` again and then install `gulp-imagemin` separately with following command: `npm install gulp-imagemin --save-dev`


## 3. Build production version
```bash
gulp build
```

## 4. Start webserver without watch task
```bash
gulp server
```
